## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2), reminiscent of Vercel's style, to convey trustworthiness and innovation.
- Background color: A very light gray (#F0F0F0) provides a clean and modern backdrop.
- Accent color: Use a bright yellow (#FFC857), analogous to green on the color wheel, to highlight key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: Use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, and readable feel.  Inter is appropriate for both headlines and body text.
- Use minimalist line icons to represent different form elements and actions, in the primary blue color.
- Employ a clean and spacious layout with a focus on single-question presentation within the chat interface.
- Use subtle, non-intrusive animations for transitions between questions and feedback on user input, similar to Vercel's smooth UI.
